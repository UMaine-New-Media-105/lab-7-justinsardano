link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/SOVGTZpWs I created a diagonal line of circles using a loop, making it diagonal by using the same number for both the x and y of the addfunction. I set the loop to be less than 15 to create 15 circles and filled the canvas by having the offset be 26.
link https://editor.p5js.org/justin.sardano/sketches/ZZBF4sifF the assignment was to create a grid out of loops, and then add a gradient. however, I ran out of time, and I couldn't figure out how to create the grid. I was able to create a whole column or row, but I couldn't get the two to interact to create a grid. I'm pretty sure there could have been something to do with multiplication, but I couldn't figure out what was supposed to be multiplied by what.
